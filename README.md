# Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Hyper-DDOS-Tool

Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Hyper-DDOS-Tool is a traffic generation utility that simulates large-scale distributed denial of service conditions to evaluate infrastructure resilience.

Designed for controlled testing, it produces configurable traffic patterns, connection rates, and payload variations to stress network stacks, firewalls, load balancers, and intrusion detection systems. 
Engineers and security teams can reproduce real-world attack scenarios, validate mitigation strategies, tune rate-limiting rules, and measure performance under pressure. 
The tool emphasizes safe lab use, clear documentation, extensible modules for custom protocols, and audit logging features. 
Use only on authorized systems and within legal boundaries. Contributors must follow repository guidelines, practice responsible disclosure, maintain secure coding.
